- important: double click to exit immediately (exits we've already been to)
- maintenance: clean up the git project, lose phonegap
- maintenance: tests (qunit)
- important: responsive (work on mobile)
- ios: tiptap to move/use - single tap only for buttons/ui
- ios: close button to close dialog (must be used)
- soon: elevation (stairs)
- options

maybe
- zoom? (for walking far away) (like elevation, it's still 2D)
- follow the camera (wide scenes) ?
- shaky camera (a la sword and sworcery) ?

definitely, but later:
- connect to drupal, you have to be logged in to play
- purchase ios/android version
- purchase drupal user role to play on desktop
